# Falcon CSS Library

I originally wrote this library for personal use. If you want to import it
yourself, feel free to do so :)

It's based on a strong usage of flexboxes to quickly and efficiently display
interface elements without requiring too much thinking or tinkering.

# General documentation

Here is a general documentation to be able to use efficiently the library.

## Display types

* `flex-row` [*class*]
Define a flex container with row-aligned children.
**example : <div class="flex-row">(...)</div>**
---
* `flex-col` [*class*]
Define a flex container with column-aligned children.
**example : <div class="flex-col">(...)</div>**
